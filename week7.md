This week, we started the SQL pipeline portion of the project. Each of us researched and decided on our own database platform to use. In the beginning of this week, I researched and decided that I would use the SQL workbench platform. I later was able to connect a python file to the SQL workbench on my laptop. I also pushed a table as well as sample data from our software into a new database. I faced numerous challengous in connecting the python script to the workbench, as well as getting used to the SQL language and database in general. We were also able to successfully complete our midsummer presentations this week. Next week, I will be focusing on pushing the tracker ID as well as the time into the table database. We will also be able to perform simple queries to analyze how many unqie jaywalkers there were as well as jaywalkers within a certain time frame.
