This week, we focused on combining all of the skills and techniques we have learned in the past few weeks. This included HSV color detection, YOLO, and ROI (Region of Interest). This week, I was able to implement ROI on its own, and then later combine this with HSV in order to select a region to focus on, and then use HSV detection on that region. I was also able to implement HSV and YOLO on a video.I faced some challenges in this area as the HSV color detection for the video was picking up alot of additonal background noise. I am still working on fixing this using median filtering. For the next week, I plan on combining HSV, YOLO, and ROI in one video. Next week we will also be using two ROI's to analyze the crosswalk and traffic signal color. This will lead into analyzing a jaywalking violation.
