This week, we focused on combining all of the skills and techniques we have learned in the past few weeks. This included HSV color detection, YOLO, and ROI (Region of Interest). This week, I was able to implement ROI on its own, and then later combine this with HSV in order to select a region to focus on, and then use HSV detection on that region. I was also able to implement HSV and YOLO on a video. For the next weekk, I plan on combining HSV, YOLO, and ROI in one video.
