This week was mainly focused on the conclusion of the project. During this week I worked on finalizing the flowcharts used for the final report and presentation. We also finalized the results and included them in the presentation. We also organized the final presentatoon and did practice runs. Apart from the final symposium, we also spent time wrapping up the research paper and adding in any last minute things.
