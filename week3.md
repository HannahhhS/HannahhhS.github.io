This week, I was able to successfully implement YOLO Object Detection in a chosen video. I was also able to research and understand the HSV color detection, and implement that in image and video. I first researched HSV color detection to gain a full understanding of how the color detection works. Once I unrderstood how the process worked, I was able to identify the ranges of the colors that I need. After that, I was able to implement bounding boxes to create a box in the region where the color was identified. During this project, I faced challenges in putting text to the image only when the actual color was detected. Furthermore, the image that I was displaying was a negative image that only included the colors detected, and not the other colors. In order to combat this, I had to be sure to not use the bitwise_and function. I was also able to output the text only if the color was detected by including an if statement to see if there was a bounding box detected. Our goals for the week also included implementing ROI on an image and video. We were unable to complete those goals this week as the HSV tasks took longer than expected. We will be researching and understanding the ROI methods next week and work on implementing and combining that with our HSV knowledge.
