This week, I worked on performing advanced sql queries and adding to the framework. I worked on implementing the tracker ID column as well as the time column. I faced challenges with the time column as I had to find how to properly update the time with minutes and seconds. Once I was able to create the required database framework, I was able to work on creating SQL queries. I first used the SQL queries to filter out the when a person was jaylwaking. I also worked on implementing the time limit into the query, so that false detections could be filtered out using the SQL database. Our team also worked on the final video and plenned for what we would include in our elevator pitch.
