This week, we finalized red light detection and implemented this across one road. I was able to get the algorithm to work and properly detect violations. However, I did face issues as sometimes the light would detect yellow and red at the same time. In these sitautions, a car was detected as being a violator even if the light was yellow. I was able to resolve this issue by talking to teamates and seeing how my teamates solved this issue. By the end, I was able to cout the light as yellow and the red light violation detection worked properly. During this week, we were also able to finalize and practice our midsummer presentations. Presentations were unfortunately cancelled and we will be presenting next week.
