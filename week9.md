This week, we worked on wrapping up the final presentation, the paper, as well as fine tuning the code. One of the major tasks for this week was running the file on a 30 min long video. I faced a couple of challenges with this, as the time still did not work as expected when updating the minutes. I addressed this issue by researching another way to display/leep track of time. We also worked on calculating the results, including the ground truth for the whole 30 min video. We were able to split the work amongst team members in order to efficiently do this. Lastly, we obtained evidence of the SQL database and program working for use in our final report. We also worked on wrapping up the final presentation as well as doing a dry run with the lab.
