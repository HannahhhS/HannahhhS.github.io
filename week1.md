During the first week, I underwent numerous bootcamp classes in which I was introduced to various topics such as advanced python topics, machine learning basics with python, introduction to data analysis with NumPy, as well as an intro to Git and Github.Through the first bootcamp week, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of data structures in python as well as how Git and Github works. By the end of the bootcamp week, I was able to complete basic machine learning analyis using the scikit learn package as well as basic data analysis using NumPy. Furthermore, I was also able to meet with my project team and gain an insight into the project work we will be doing.
