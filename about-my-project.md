## About My Project

Queryable Computer Vision Pipeline for Traffic Video Analysis

Problem: Exporing how Traffic video footage can be analyzed using OpenCV libraries and YOLO. 

Approach: During this project, I will work in a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Analyze video footage using the OpenCV Computer Vision tools in python
  - Use YOLO to analyze objects from the video feed, assign tracking numbers, and understand the objects behavior
  - Analyze and understand the collected data using mySQL.

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the DREU program. The poster will focus on the system's technical architecture.
